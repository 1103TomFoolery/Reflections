Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me see the bug that was introduced by indicating what had changed between the two versions.
Having access to previous versions allows me to easily compare versions and see what changes may have caused unwanted functionality.
Autosave is great for locally saving your work in case there is a catastrophic failure.  Being able to manually control when you commit to source control makes it possible to version control only when you are ready.
Applications often require changes to multiple files in order for updates to work properly.
git log and git diff can be used to identify which commit a specific change was made then comparing it to any other commit in the history.
Using version control would make me more confident about making changes because I know I can revert back to previous versions.
